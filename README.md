# Looker Extension Vue Example

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT AND IS NOT OFFICIALLY (OR UNOFFICIALLY SUPPORTED).

Consider this as a start off point for developing Looker extensions
using the Vue framework.

It loads and runs from a development server.

TODO

1. Add style support
2. Add image support
3. Add a production build (the build works but the result has not been tested).
