# Looker Extension Vue Example

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT AND IS NOT OFFICIALLY (OR UNOFFICIALLY) SUPPORTED.

Consider this as a starting point for developing Looker extensions
using the Vue framework.

## TODO

- eslint
- test
- typescript

## DONE

- Add style support - seems to work.
- Hot loading
- Add a production build - tested, seems to work.
- Add image support - images are inlined. Use judiciously!
- Code splitting - seems to work
